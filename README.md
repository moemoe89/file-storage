## Installation

### 1. Set Up Golang Development Environment

See the following page to download and install Golang.

https://go.dev/doc/install

### 2. Install Development Utility Tools

You can install all tools for development and deployment for this service by running:

```sh
$ go mod download
```

```sh
$ make install
```

---

## Development workflow and guidelines

### 1. API

This project using gRPC and Protocol Buffers, thus all needed data like Service definition, RPC's list, Entities will store in [api/proto](api/proto) directory.

If you unfamiliar with Protocol Buffer, please visit this link for the detail:

* https://protobuf.dev

For generating the Proto files, make sure to have these libs installed on your system, please refer to this link:

* https://buf.build/
* https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation
* https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/

The validation for this API using `protoc-gen-validate`, for the detail please refer to this lib:

* https://github.com/bufbuild/protoc-gen-validate

This service also implementing gRPC-Gateway with this library:

* https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway

For generating the gRPC-Gateway and OpenAPI files, there's required additional package such as:

* github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
* github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2

Then, generating the Protobuf files can be done my this command:

```sh
$ make protoc
```

#### NOTE:

If you have any difficulties installing all dependencies needed for generating the proto files,
you can easily build the docker image and use that instead.

Here are 2 commands for building and generating:

```shell
make build-protoc
make docker-protoc
```

### 2. Object Storage

Instead storing the files to disk, this project use [MinIO](https://min.io) as an Object Storage to store the files.
You can follow the installation from the official page, or easily run this docker-compose command to setup everything including the bucket. 

```sh
$ docker-compose -f ./development/docker-compose.yml up minio
```

For create the default bucket:

```sh
$ docker-compose -f ./development/docker-compose.yml up createbuckets
```

### 3. Instrumentation

This service implements [https://opentelemetry.io/](https://opentelemetry.io/) to enable instrumentation in order to measure the performance.
The data exported to Jaeger and can be seen in the Jaeger UI [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686)

For running the Jaeger exporter, easily run with docker-compose command:

```sh
$ docker-compose -f ./development/docker-compose.yml up jaeger
```

### 4. Unit Test

You can simply execute the following command to run all test cases in this service:

```sh
$ make test
```

### 5. Linter

For running the linter make sure these libraries already installed in your system:

* https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint
* https://github.com/yoheimuta/protolint

Then checks the Go and Proto code style using lint can be done with this command:

```sh
$ make lint
```

### 6. Mock

This service using Mock in some places like in the repository, usecase, pkg, etc.
To automatically updating the mock if the interface changed, easily run with `go generate` command:

```sh
$ make mock
```

### 7. Run the service

For running the service, you need the database running and set up some env variables:

```
# app config
export APP_ENV=dev
export SERVER_PORT=8080

# minio config
export MINIO_HOST=localhost:9000
export MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin
export MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin

# tracing config
export OTEL_AGENT=http://localhost:14268/api/traces
```

Or you can just execute the sh file:

```sh
$ ./scripts/run.sh
```

### 8. Test the service

The example how to call the gRPC service written in Golang can be seen on this [example-client](scripts/example-client) file.

> NOTE: To test this service need the migration to be done. After that you can choose the User ID's from 1 to 5.
 
If you want to test by GUI client, you can use either BloomRPC (although already no longer active) or Postman.
For the detail please visit these links:
* https://github.com/bloomrpc/bloomrpc
* https://www.postman.com

Basically you just need to import the [api/proto/service.proto](api/proto/service.proto) file if you want to test via BloomRPC / Postman.

> NOTE: There will be a possibility issue when importing the proto file to BloomRPC or Postman.
> It is caused by some path issue, the usage of `gRPC Gateway` and `protoc-gen-validate` library.
> To solve this issue, there's need a modification for the proto file.

#### BloomRPC

BloomRPC will have these issues when trying to import the proto file:

```
Error while importing protos
illegal name ';' (/path/file-storage/api/proto/service.proto, line 14)

Error while importing protos
no such type: e.Transaction
```

need to remove gRPC Gateway related annotations:

```protobuf
option (grpc.gateway.protoc_gen_openapiv2.options.openapiv2_swagger) = {
  ...
};
```

#### Postman

There's some issue when importing to Postman. Basically we need to do the same things like BloomRPC (remove gRPC Gateway related annotations) and disable the protoc annotations import.

```protobuf
import "protoc-gen-openapiv2/options/annotations.proto";
```

To this:

```protobuf
// import "protoc-gen-openapiv2/options/annotations.proto";
```

Also don't forget to set the import path e.g. `{YOUR-DIR}/file-storage/api/proto`

#### gRPC-Gateway

This service has HTTP server built on gRPC-Gateway, if you prefer to test using HTTP instead HTTP2 protocol,
you can copy the Swagger file here [api/openapiv2/proto/service.swagger.json](api/openapiv2/proto/service.swagger.json) and then copy paste to this URL https://editor.swagger.io/

By default, HTTP server running on gRPC port + 1, if the gRPC port is 8080, then HTTP server will run on 8081.

# NOTE

> If you have any difficulties to run the service, easily just run all dependencies by docker-compose for the example:
> 
> `docker-compose -f ./development/docker-compose.yml up`
>
> Then you will have all services running like `minio`, `jaeger` and run `file-storage` server.

## Project Structure

This project follow https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout

However, for have a clear direction when working in this project, here are some small guide about each directory:

* [api](api): contains Protobuf files, generated protobuf, swagger, etc.
* [build](build): Docker file for the service, migration, etc.
* [cmd](cmd): main Go file for running the service, producer, consumer, etc.
* [development](development): file to support development like docker-compose.
* [docs](docs): file about project documentations such as diagram, sequence diagram, etc.
* [internal](internal): internal code that can't be shared.
  * [internal/adapters/grpchandler](internal/adapters/grpchandler): adapter layer that serve into gRPC service.
  * [internal/di](internal/di): dependencies injection for connecting each layer.
* [pkg](pkg): package code that can be shared.
* [scripts](scripts): shell script, go script to help build or testing something.
* [tools](tools): package that need to store on go.mod in order to easily do installation.

## GitHub Actions CI

This project has GitHub Actions CI to do some automation such as:

* [lint](.github/workflows/lint.yml): check the code style.
* [test](.github/workflows/test.yml): run unit testing and uploaded code coverage artifact.
* [generate-proto](.github/workflows/generate-proto.yml): generates protobuf files.
* [generate-diagram](.github/workflows/generate-diagram.yml): generates graph code visualization.
* [push-file](.github/workflows/push-file.yml): commit and push generated proto, diagram as github-actions[bot] user.
